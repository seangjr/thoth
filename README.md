## Project structure

Thoth uses the following stack of development tools and frameworks:

-   [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal approach for designing routes and RESTful APIs. It improves code cleanliness and ease to perform CRUD.
-   [PHP](https://php.net/) is used for templating and rendering data from the server.
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/) is used as our CSS Framework in creating beautiful UI which users will love.
